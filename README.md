A non-serious attempt at creating a good classifier.

Mostly, just testing tools against a dataset. For more info, look at the .ipynb files.

Files:

- data manipulation, visualizations are in *iceberg.ipynb*
- simple CNN model is in *cnn.ipynb*, acc: 73%
- more complicated CNN in *cnn-extended.ipynb*, acc: 87%
